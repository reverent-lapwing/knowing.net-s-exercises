# About

"15 Exercises to Know a Programing Language" is a set of programming challenges intended for programmers wanting to learn a new programming languages in a meaningful way. It is structured in such a way, that after finishing the exercises, coder will be able to write a complete, full-featured program with a language of their choice.

For me personally, those exercises are a great vehicle to work with languages that I love or that interest me in any way, but I cannot use in my daily work due to the nature of my job as a C++ developer.
